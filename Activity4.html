    <p>I am a stay at home mom of two girls. My oldest daughter is 16, my younger daughter is 5. I do not 
        recommend doing it that way!  I live in Park City with my husband, two girls, two dogs, and cat. 
    </p>
        
    <p>I was employed by a small private community for 12 years. In my time there
        I worked as an accountant, IT, and Project Manager. 
    </p>

    <p>I decided to learn to code because as IT I got a small taste of front end development while creating the
        club website for members. I worked with preloaded css info that I didn't understand at all. My end goal would
        be to be a game developer, but web developer is ok too if that is where the market is at. I will work to create
        a game on my own if I am able to learn what I need here, and personal studies.
    </p>

    <p>I realize that we already have an about me page made, so I linked it in the below info.</p>
